- **Better caching**: Static assets cached globally
- **Database optimization**: Connection pooling for serverless
- **Asset optimization**: Automatic image and code optimization

### **Developer Experience:**
- **Simplified deployment**: Git push → automatic deployment
- **Environment management**: Netlify dashboard for variables
- **Monitoring**: Built-in function logs and analytics
- **Preview deployments**: Automatic staging for pull requests

## 📋 Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done)
2. **Connect GitHub to Netlify**
3. **Set environment variables** in Netlify dashboard
4. **Deploy and test** all functionality
5. **Configure custom domain** (optional)
6. **Set up monitoring** and alerts

## 🔧 Environment Variables to Set in Netlify

```bash
# Required
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret-key
NODE_ENV=production

# Optional
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-site.netlify.app
VITE_API_URL=/.netlify/functions
LOG_LEVEL=info
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=24h

# Email (Optional)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password

# JumpCloud Integration (Optional)
JUMPCLOUD_API_KEY=your-api-key
JUMPCLOUD_ORG_ID=your-org-id
```
